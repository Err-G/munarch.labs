# unu Virtual Machine

`unu` is a lightweight virtual machine written in C,
designed for learning about CPU instructions and Forth.
Inspired by minimalist VMs such as `uxn` and `nga`,
`unu` has a memory area, two stacks (data and return),
and a set of instructions that can be executed. The VM 
initializes its memory and stacks before executing the 
instructions in memory.

`unu` is a great starting point for those who want to
learn about Virtual Machines and CPU instruction sets
(`unu` is MISC).
